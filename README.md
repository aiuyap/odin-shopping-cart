# Shopping Website

The Odin Project - React Course - Project: Shopping Cart. This project taught me more about the fundamentals of React. I was able to utilize hooks like useState, useEffect and useOutletContext. I also learned about SPAs (Single Page Application) and utilized React Router to build it. I am also able to practice using a component library like shadcn/ui and lucide for icons. I also learned about type checking using PropTypes. I also used a third party API (Fake Store API) to populate the store.
